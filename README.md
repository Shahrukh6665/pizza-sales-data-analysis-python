Python-based sales analysis of pizza store transactions — KPIs, trends, and visualizations.

# Pizza Sales Analysis (Python)

**Overview**  
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of a pizza store's transactional sales dataset. The analysis computes core KPIs (total revenue, total pizzas sold, total orders, AOV), inspects trends (hourly, daily, monthly), and identifies top/bottom performers and category/size distributions — all using Python data analysis libraries. The project scope and business objectives are defined in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
