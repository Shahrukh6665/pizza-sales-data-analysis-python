# Pizza Sales Analysis (Python)

**Overview**  
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of a pizza store's transactional sales dataset. The analysis computes core KPIs (total revenue, total pizzas sold, total orders, AOV), inspects trends (hourly, daily, monthly), and identifies top/bottom performers and category/size distributions — all using Python data analysis libraries.
